Socket.io Foundation Project
=================

Designed to be a project you can remix to instantly have the base dependencies for sockets and p5.js

Built upon Glitch's basic hello-express project, with the following changes:

- package.json has socketio dependency (v1.0.0)
- server.js with basic socket connections to default namespace and output namespace
- public folder with sketch.js, index.html, style.css:
  - sketch.js -- basic p5 setup/draw with socket
  - index.html -- barebones with socket.io and p5.js (v1.0.0)
  - style.css -- emptied
- identical "output" folder inside public for shared screen output
