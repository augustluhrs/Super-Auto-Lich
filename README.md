  ## Playtest Notes

  ### 0.0.2

  **7/22/22
  - first instinct was to click on the monsters, had to be told to drag
  - no indication when they don't have enough money to do something, and no warning if they want to ready up while they still have a lot of money
  - info boxes were basically not read or sought after
  - "stirge is OP"
  - "ooh skeleton, cool art"
  - mephits are very destructive and hard to strategize for first time players, not very clear what they do from animations
  - running slow for some reason... too many monsters? something about when the images are tinted red?
  - unclear how to move party members in line or that it was even a possibility
  - "how could I have won?" general strategy unclear

  **Misc. Balance Thoughts**
  - Bear too strong -- maybe just bumps HP?
    - wow but 12 kobolds and 12 bears have the same sum total power + hp after abilities...
    - no still too strong. nerfing power
  - goblins suck compared to skeletons, 16% chance at lvl 1 vs 100% chance + extra... maybe should bump to 20% base?
  - skelly immune to spores atm, b/c they're "dead" -- kinda cool flavor
  - damn stirge basically can't be killed by anything with 1 power, unless abilities (spores), ah can also get stuck in infinite loop. Should have tie timer

  ### 0.0.1

  **6/17/22**
  - dupes party if you drag party slots after first battle
  - pulling from hires on return to market shows wrong unless refresh
  - server.js  index line 146 i of null -- why null?
